# Effective C++ - Third Edition

## Chapter 01 - Accustoming Yourself to C++
[Item 1: View C++ as a federation of languages](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter01/01.cpp)  
[Item 2: Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to #defines](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter01/02.cpp)  
[Item 3: Use const whenever possible](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter01/03.cpp)  
[Item 4: Make sure that objects are initialized before they're used](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter01/04.cpp)  

## Chapter 02 - Constructors, Destructors, and Assignment Operators
[Item 5: Know what functions C++ silently writes and calls](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter02/05.cpp)  
[Item 6: Explictly disallow the use of compiler-generated functions you do not wnat](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter02/06.cpp)  
[Item 7: Declare destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter02/07.cpp)  
[Item 8: Prevent exception from leaving destructors](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter02/08.cpp)  
[Item 9: Never call virtual functions during construction or destruction](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter02/09.cpp)  
[Item 10: Have assignment operators return a reference to *this](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter02/10.cpp)  
[Item 11: Handle assignment to self in operator=](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter02/11.cpp)  
[Item 12: Copy all parts of an object](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter02/12.cpp)  

## Chapter 03 - Resource Management
[Item 13: Use objects to manage resources](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter03/13.cpp)  
[Item 14: Think carefully about the copying behavior in resource-manageing classes](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter03/14.cpp)  
[Item 15: Provide access to raw resources in resources-managing classes](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter03/15.cpp)  
[Item 16: Use the same form in corresponding uses of new and delete](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter03/16.cpp)  
[Item 17: Store newed objects in smart pointers in standalone statements](https://github.com/pingsoli/cpp/blob/master/tutorials/effective_cpp/chapter03/17.cpp)
