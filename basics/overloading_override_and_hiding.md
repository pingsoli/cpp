## Overloading, Overriding and Hiding in C++

Overloading: two or more functions in the same scope having the same name.

Overriding: virtual function in base class, write a function with same signature
in derived class, the function in the derived class overrides the function of
the base.

Hiding: the base class are always hidden by function of the same name in a
derived class; no matter if the function in the derived class overrides a base
class virutal function or not.
